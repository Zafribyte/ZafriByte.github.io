            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6 lead"><p>I mean who does not want their better half to have and to hold? Not me, for certain. I have always imagined myself with my better half, hosting picnics under the Morula trees of Winterveldt, or star gazing in Lesotho's Thaba Ntlenyana, and allowing our wanderlust adventures to take us everywhere we want to go.<br /><br />  <br /><br />  It is not easy being found by someone who genuinely loves you, and being single takes the reigns until such time. I have learned to know that I am enough, and that being single is a gift to be celebrated.</p></div>
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6 lead"><p>Upcoming South African author, Masingita Mzilikazi Masiya's book Home Beyond February is an anthology of poems about love, giving you all phases love goes through. The book celebrated love in the confines of a relationship, the ups and downs, and how we all have that one person we will always love for life, apart or otherwise.<br/><br/> </p> In as much as some of us love having partners being single gives you a chance to know what you like, what you want and how to be happy all on your own. One of Nigeria's famous authors, Chimamanda Ngozi Adiche's famous quotes reads: "I think you travel to search and you come home to find yourself there."</div>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4 lead"><p>In this case we will take travelling as the process of being in a relationship, were you spend time and money to get to know the other person. This person travels with enough utensils (love, patience, kindness, sanity), to make the journey a success, yet it does not always work out. That is when you need to go back home to yourself (being single). To heal and re-evaluate the relationship, to forgive yourself and the person you were with (if needs be), and move on with life. </p></div>
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4 lead"><p>To be single means trusting your instincts, and to give your best years to yourself. It pushes us to want to know ourselves better so that when the next person comes through, we know that which we want. You need to date yourself, wake up, dress up and paint the town red with whatever tickles your fancy. Indulge in your favourite book, host friends over brunch, write in your diary, paint, make a vision board, and simply enjoy life. </p></div>
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4 lead"><p>It is in finding your authentic self that you attract what is rightfully yours. The need to spend time with yourself is of importance as it teaches you to enjoy your own space. You learn to love all the good, the bad, and the ugly you have to offer. You get to allow yourself to search deep within yourself, to find unhealed wounds and heal.</p></div>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6 lead"><p>The process of solitude reaches self love within you and teaches you to believe in your strength. It reassures you of your own ability to go through emotions and come out victorious. Do not forget to share your emotions, be it in your diary, with your friends, through a prayer or even through a poem.<br /><br />  <br /><br />Let people carry you when you are weak, and always return the favour. Spend time with people who challenge you to be better and happier. This makes your soul smile and it will show on your face. We all know how contagious a smile is, and being happy makes you light up each room you step into.</p></div>
                <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6 lead"><p>One quote I came across that left me with a smile on my face read as follows: "The only thing I'm committed to right now is bettering myself." This means meditation, self-introspection and applying all that you know makes you happy. The process of bettering yourself begins with a vision of where you would like to see yourself, then you set achievable goals that will lead you there.<br /><br />Do not forget to celebrate the failures as this will teach you to see life as a learning curve. Celebrate the achievements too as this will motivate you to push yourself further than this. Allow yourself to bask in your own love and always remember that you are enough. Iron that three piece suit, blow dry your hair, and love the human being who looks back at you in the mirror.  </p></div>

                <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4 lead"><p>The saying "When you do good you feel good," is right because it builds in you confidence to face each day as it comes. Smelling nice also adds to the confidence, so make sure to have your favourite scent handy. A good book always provides you with an escape from the real world, giving you an opportunity to remember how we all have our paths to walk. Why not walk the path feeling confident and ready to release your greatness.<br/><br/> Things to do as a single person:<br/><br/>
                    Find a new hobby.<br/><br/> A new hobby means meeting new people and learning to get out of your comfort zone. Try gardening herbs as these are good for our bodies, or your favourite flowers. DIY tips are everywhere from libraries and the internet. Gardening is therapeutic, it teaches you continue to dig for gold even when weeds show their face. It teaches you patience as you watch your plants grow, and anticipate the final result.</p></div>
                <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4 lead"><p> Invite friends for lunch.<br/><br/>Try new recipes that you were too scared to try in a relationship and invite your friends over. Seeing each other and catching up over a good meal has never hurt one. You can even get them to come help you cook, and experience the process together, while making memories. Ask your chef friends for easy, healthy and delicious recipes and go the organic food route for a day. Do not forget to take pictures and be the envy of everyone who was not invited.<br/><br/> Start exercising.<br/><br/> Nothing releases endorphins (happiness chemicals produced by your brain) in your body like exercising plus you get to have a killer body. You can simply add hot pepper to your food or eat chocolate to release endorphins. The rush you will feel is sure to make you smile and thank yourself for exercising. Exercising is also another great medium to use to meet new people and find yourself a jogging partner or two.</p></div>
                <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4 lead"><p>Get out the house.<br/><br/>Take a walk, visit your neighbour or simply go to that museum you have been postponing to visit. Stepping out of the house reminds you that you are not alone. Go spend a day with the less fortunate and give them your time. You will get to see how lucky you are and appreciate your life a little bit more. <br/><br/> Talk about it.<br/><br/> Listen to other people share their stories about being single gives you courage to continue your journey, plus you might also learn a thing or two. To be single means putting up with lovey-dovey couples at restaurants, at the mall, at the corner before your house and all around you. This can be quite difficult as we all long for someone to love us, but its best to love ourselves first, than wait for someone to come and make us happy.</p></div>

Getting out of the house is a necessity especially if all you do is walk about doing nothing. If you are not up to going alone, invite a friend. Who says no to popcorn and a 3-D movie? Nobody. Trust us on that one</p></div>
                <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6 lead"><p>Go to the movies.<br /><br /> Remember all that money you forgot to save? Well, now is the right time to start saving but before you do that, hit the road.
